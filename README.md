# StringIterator
A simple utility for iterating through strings

# Why?
Recently i needed to read a custom file format and there wasn't any eazy way to iterate through the characters in it.
So heres a simple utility i made just for that!
Its pretty basic but it does its job well.

# Using the library
You can just copy the "StringIterator.cs" to your project and then include the "Marinkas.Utils" namespace
Then just create a new instance of StringIterator with the string you would like to iterate through.
