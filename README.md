# StringIterator
A simple utility for iterating trough strings

# Why?
Recently i needed to read a custom file format and there wasn't any eazy way to iterate through strings so heres a simple utility i made just for that!
Its pretty basic but it does its job well.

# Using the library
You can just copy the "StringIterator.cs" to your project and then include Marinkas.Utils
